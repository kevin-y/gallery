# Introduction

Gallery is an open source demo project, anyone can copy and distribute it. If you want to use it for commercial purpose or any other purposes, it's okay, but without any guarantees.
<br>It's built on plenty of open source tools, such as AngularJS, jQuery, Spring Framework, RabbitMQ, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB, Nginx and Tomcat etc.
<br>The reason why I don't officially give it a particular name is just because I have not come up with one yet, LOL.
Well, I'll attempt to integrate more tools to provide powerful functionalities in the future.
Please wait, :P!!!
